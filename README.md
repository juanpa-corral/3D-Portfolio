# JPCODAI - Software Architecture & AI Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio website, **JPcodai**.

This portfolio serves as a showcase of my ability to build **scalable, high-performance systems** while integrating **Data Science and Machine Learning (AI/ML)** capabilities.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Dual Focus:** Demonstrates expertise in both **Software Architecture** (Full Stack Engineering) and **Data/AI Solutions**.
* **Modern Stack:** Built using **React, Tailwind CSS, and React Three Fiber (R3F)** for immersive 3D visualization.
* **Scroll-Driven UI:** Features complex scroll animations using **GSAP (ScrollTrigger)** for a dynamic user experience.
* **Architecture Focus:** The interactive 3D model visualizes a modular software and data processing stack.

## üß† Core Expertise Demonstrated

| Pillar | Focus | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | Scalability, System Design | **Java/Spring Boot**, **OCI/AWS**, Microservices |
| **Engineering** | Full Stack Development, DevOps | **React.js**, **CI/CD (Jenkins, Docker)**, Git Workflows |
| **Intelligence** | Predictive Modeling, Data Analysis | **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, DBSCAN, Isolation Forest |
| **Impact** | Automation, Decision Support | Optimization, Precision-Recall Curves |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Setup

This project uses **Vite** as a build tool.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18+)
* npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/juanpa-corral/jp-portfolio.git](https://github.com/juanpa-corral/jp-portfolio.git)
    cd jp-portfolio
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install 
    # OR: npm install --force (if facing React 19 dependency conflicts)
    ```
3.  **Run locally:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Deployment (Build for Production)

To generate the optimized static files for deployment (e.g., to Hostinger, Netlify, Vercel):

```bash
npm run build
